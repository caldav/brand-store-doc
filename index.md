# Introduction

## The Ubuntu snap store

The Ubuntu snap store is enabled by default on Ubuntu Core images and classic systems running snapd. It allows developers to release free or paid apps for multiple architectures, on multiple release channels from daily builds to stable releases.

Follow the [step-by-step guide](https://snapcraft.io/docs/build-snaps/publish) to learn how to distribute snaps to your devices through the Ubuntu snap store.

## Brand stores

Canonical can help setting up branded stores that represent specific brand or devices, giving the brand full control over the store content, reviewing process and identity.

Brand stores can inherit selected packages from other snap stores and host a set of snaps specific to the brand and device models. They can be opened to all developers or only to a hand-picked list.
