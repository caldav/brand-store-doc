## The Ubuntu snap store

The Ubuntu snap store is enabled by default on Ubuntu Core images and classic systems running snapd. It allows developers to release free or paid apps for multiple architectures, on multiple release channels from daily builds to stable releases.

To learn how to distribute snaps to your devices through the main snap store, heads on to this step-by-step guide:

## Brand stores

If you need a store dedicated to your brand and devices, only accessible from them and under your control, you can get in touch with Canonical to request a brand store.

Brand stores can inherit selected packages from other snap stores and host a set of snaps specific to your brand and device models. They can be opened to all developers or only to a hand-picked list.

If you are an admin or reviewer of an existing brand store, or are interested in requesting a brand store, this documentation will walk you through:

* [Setting up your brand store for reviewers and developers to use](/core/en/build-store/client-setup.html)
* [Changing its settings and tuning security policies for automated reviews](/core/en/build-store/manage.html)
* [Enabling developers to push and release snaps to it](/core/en/build-store/develop.html)
* [Reporting issues and getting in touch for support](/core/en/build-store/issues.html)

First, let's have a look at how to request the creation of a brand store.
